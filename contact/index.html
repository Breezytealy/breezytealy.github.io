<h2>Commissions currently full! Please check back later :) </h2>

<p>I'm available for commissions! Previous commissioned work is listed here with prices [link] and examples of what's possible is here [link]. This could be anything from inking up or editing your figures for a paper, diagrams for a teacher's worksheet or unique presents for your academic friends and students.</p>

<!-- NB: I will not create figures for school, under- or post-graduate work/dissertations/theses. However, if you'd like to order a fancy illustration for you, your student or a friend's graduation to celebrate their work then that's perfect! -->

<p>We can chat absolutely free of charge, and I'll happily take a rough sketch of what you want. Alternatively I can read your paper and make suggestions (which often inspires your own ideas), though this consultation stage is folded into the final cost as it takes time. I'll then work up my own sketch if necessary and after approval will need 50% payment before proceeding.</p>

<p>I'll keep you informed at major milestones to ensure you're getting exactly what you need. Before sending the final .png, .eps or .svg I will require the rest of the payment.</p>

<p>Typically illustrations can take three weeks from initial to final email depending on the level of communication and edits required. Often turn-around time is shorter if the project is simple and using a workflow I'm familiar with, but please don't bank on it!</p>

<h2>What's the cost?</h2>

<p>Every commissioned piece is unique and so I can only offer case studies. We'd need to chat to get the exact price. <p>

<p>Edits on a figure or two you already have the file for can be £20. Inking up your sketches £20-50. Vectoring a figure £40. Simple wood-cut style illustrations £70-100. Highly colourful and technical hi-res pieces including an idea generation period can be ~£250.</p>

<h3> Aah! That's too much! </h3>

<p>Don't worry! To keep your costs down I do have a print store! Feel free to make suggestions for the store and I may just add what you want, although it won't be unique! If you want a pre-existing print as a base with some edits then you're more than welcome to request this and it'll be much cheaper (changing colours and fiddling with the design to add a name or thesis title can be as little as £10). Again, after payment I'll send you the file to print yourself however you wish!</p>
